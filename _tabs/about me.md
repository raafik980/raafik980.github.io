As a graduate student pursuing a Ph.D. in the [Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry](https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/science/departments/chemistry) at the [University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/), I am actively engaged in computational chemistry research under the mentorship of [Dr. Kwangho Nam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fUPBlikAAAAJ&hl=en). My work focuses on developing and applying multiscale quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methodologies to investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of chemical catalysis within enzyme environments. Alongside traditional sampling approaches, I'm exploring the integration of machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency of analyzing complex chemical systems.

Additionally, I am a trained electrochemist, particularly interested in the areas of fuel cells and rechargeable redox flow batteries. My current research in this direction involves studying the electrostatic effects of the electrical double layer (EDL) at electrode/electrolyte interfaces, contributing to advancements in energy storage and electrochemical processes.

- **Dynamic Perspectives on Catalytic Function in Adenylate Kinase**
  * <u>Collaboration</u>: [Dr. Magnus Wolf-Watz](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/magnus-wolf-watz/)
  * <u>Description</u>: In our project, we aim to understand the catalytic mechanism of adenylate kinase using a combination of classical molecular dynamics and QM/MM simulations. Our particular interest lies in examining the role of protein dynamics in the enzyme's catalytic function. Additionally, we are exploring the evolutionary trajectory of adenylate kinase's thermoadaptation across different species with the aid of Alphafold2 predicted structures.
