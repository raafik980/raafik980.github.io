## **Abdul Raafik Arattu Thodika**
*Computational Chemistry&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biophysics* 
- - -

I am currently a graduate student pursuing a Ph.D. in the [Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry](https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/science/departments/chemistry) at the [University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/). Under the guidance of [Dr. Kwangho Nam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fUPBlikAAAAJ&hl=en), my research focuses on computational chemistry. Specifically, I am dedicated to the development and application of multiscale quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methodologies. These methodologies are utilized to study thermodynamics & kinetics associated with chemical catalysis within complex enzyme environments. In addition to conventional sampling approaches, I have a keen interest in utilizing machine learning techniques to expedite the sampling of complex chemical systems with improved accuracy.

I am also a trained electrochemist with experience in working with fuel cells and rechargeable redox flow batteries.

> *In addition to academics, I take pleasure in digital illustrations and content design. This passion developed when I joined the design team for the 2018 student media body ['Kalpa'](https://kalpa.iiserpune.ac.in/) at IISER Pune. Since then, I have actively pursued this interest through personal projects and some commissioned collaborations.*
