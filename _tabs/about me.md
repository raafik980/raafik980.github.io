As a graduate student pursuing a Ph.D. in the [Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry](https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/science/departments/chemistry) at the [University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/), I am actively engaged in computational chemistry research under the mentorship of [Dr. Kwangho Nam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fUPBlikAAAAJ&hl=en). My work focuses on developing and applying multiscale quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methodologies to investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of chemical catalysis within enzyme environments. Alongside traditional sampling approaches, I'm exploring the integration of machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency of analyzing complex chemical systems.

Additionally, I am a trained electrochemist, particularly interested in the areas of fuel cells and rechargeable redox flow batteries. My current research in this direction involves studying the electrostatic effects of the electrical double layer (EDL) at electrode/electrolyte interfaces, contributing to advancements in energy storage and electrochemical processes.

### Ongoing Projects

- **Machine Learning Potentials for Free Energy Simulations of Enzymatic Reactions**
  * <u>Collaboration</u>: [Dr. Xiaoliang Pan](https://panxl.net/)
  * <u>Description</u>: In the ongoing work, we undertake a comprehensive re-examination of the MLP architecture introduced by [Pan et al](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00565) (for QM/MM free energy simulations) to rigorously evaluate the transferability of a pre-trained machine learning potential (MLP) and &Delta;MLP model along the space of enzyme mutations. Enzyme mutations studied range from a single-point substitution to a homologous enzyme from different species and even water.

- **Dynamic Perspectives on Catalytic Function in Adenylate Kinase**
  * <u>Collaboration</u>: [Dr. Magnus Wolf-Watz](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/magnus-wolf-watz/)
  * <u>Description</u>: In our project, we aim to understand the catalytic mechanism of adenylate kinase using a combination of classical molecular dynamics and QM/MM simulations. Our particular interest lies in examining the role of protein dynamics in the enzyme's catalytic function. Additionally, we are exploring the evolutionary trajectory of adenylate kinase's thermoadaptation across different species with the aid of Alphafold2 predicted structures.

- **Electrostatic Effects of the Electrical Double Layer (EDL) at Electrode/Electrolyte Interfaces**
  * <u>Collaboration</u>: [Dr. Musthafa Ottakam Thotiyil](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/research/department/chemistry/people/faculty/regular-faculty/muhammed-musthafa/304)
  * <u>Description</u>: In this project, we are exploring how modifications to the electrode surface might influence the electrostatic effects of the electrical double layer (EDL) at electrode/electrolyte interfaces. This investigation could impact the flux of ions, electrocatalytic activity, and the overall performance of electrochemical devices through the modulation of electrode surface potential.

> *In addition to academics, I take pleasure in digital illustrations and content design. This passion developed when I joined the design team for the 2018 student media body ['Kalpa'](https://kalpa.iiserpune.ac.in/) at IISER Pune. Since then, I have actively pursued this interest through personal projects and some commissioned collaborations.*
